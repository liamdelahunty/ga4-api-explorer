To activate your virtual environment and install dependencies:

   1. Activate: Open your terminal, navigate to your project, and run:

   .\venv\Scripts\activate (PowerShell), 

   .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat (Command Prompt). 

   source venv/Scripts/activate (Git Bash)

   Your prompt will show (venv).

   2. Install Dependencies: With the environment active, run pip install -r requirements.txt.

  This isolates project libraries, preventing conflicts.
