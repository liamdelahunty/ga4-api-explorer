  Completed Since Last Checkpoint:
   * Full Command-Line Flag Support: run_report.py now accepts flags for property, report, date range (-sd, -ed), and output format (-o), allowing for non-interactive
     execution.
   * Cache Cleanup: Implemented an automatic cleanup for stale cache files.
   * Configurable Settings: CACHE_DURATION has been moved to a new settings.py file for easier management.
   * Alphabetical Output Format Sorting: The output format menu is now sorted alphabetically.
   * New "Top Pages Report": A new report to show top 25 pages by views has been added to reports/top_pages_report.py.
   * New "Channel Overview Report": A new report to show channel data by new users and engaged sessions has been added to reports/channel_overview_report.py.
   * Improved Output Filenaming: Filenames for saved reports now reflect the actual date range (e.g., report-title-YYYY-MM-DD-to-YYYY-MM-DD).
   * Updated Documentation: README.md and SETUP_GUIDE.md have been updated to reflect these changes.

  Next Task (Pending):
   * Refine Date Range Logic (Add more non-interactive date flags): Implement command-line flags for predefined date ranges like --last-7-days, --last-28-days,
     --last-calendar-month.
   * Further work on "Channel Overview Report": We simplified this to a single-table output for general date ranges, but the complex "last year by complete calendar month"
     requirement (with two pivoted tables) is still outstanding if you decide to pursue it.

  I am ready to resume tomorrow from this point. Please let me know what you'd like to tackle first then.

-- 
make a way of getting a years worth of data
Should be complete calander months, so Dec 24, Jan 25, Feb 25 etc

--

For each property get
Traffic Acquisition:	User	
User Acquisition: New Users

for the last calendar month


--

For each property get Tech details desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.

Calculate the %ge of traffic for each

Show the bounce rate by tech type

--

Change this:

What would you like to do next?
(R)un another report for this property
(C)hange property
(Q)uit


So that I can run the same report and date range on another property. I then select the property and it runs the same report type, the same date range, the same output.

Cache the "Available GA4 Properties:" after the first load unless requested a fresh load via a command line flag.
